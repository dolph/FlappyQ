# FlappyQat


This game bases on the Flappy bird game. It is idea is to get familiar with quantum 
computing and have fun at the same time!

You start with the initial quantum state eg. `|00>` and by passing the quantum pipes and selecting the proper gate you are supposed to achive the disered state eg. `|01>`.  
During the game tha actual quantum state is evaluted using the quantum device 
(or quantum emulator)!
