# FlappyQat


This game based on the Flappy Bird game. It is idea is to get familiar with quantum 
computing and have fun at the same time!

You start with the initial quantum state eg. `|00>` and by passing the quantum pipes and selecting the proper gate you are supposed to achieve the desired state eg. `|01>`.  
During the game, the actual quantum state is evaluated using the quantum device 
(or quantum emulator)!
